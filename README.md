I'm cooking up this project called "ForumSkuy," and it's like a Twitter clone but with my own twist, all powered by PHP. It's just me, my laptop, and a whole lot of coffee, diving into the world of server-side scripting. I'm crafting this platform where users can tweet, follow each other, and dive into conversations â€“ all in real-time. From login pages to timelines, I'm coding it all from scratch, adding those PHP functionalities to make it pop. It's not just about building a website; it's about creating a digital hangout spot where users can vibe and connect. So, buckle up, 'cause we're diving deep into the world of web dev, one tweet at a time!
